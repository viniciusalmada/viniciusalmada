I discovered programming in the first semester of the Civil Engineering degree. I didn't have a computer and I wanted to create programs for Android device, so I started there to study Android development.

I developed some projects for the community of students in my course and also focused on scientific research.

Today, I am a student of the master's degree in Applied Computer Graphics and develop my research at the Tecgraf Institute of PUC / Rio, in the Geological Modeling group.
